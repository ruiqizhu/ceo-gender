costs  we regularly analyze our workers compensation claims to identify trends  this allows us to focus our resources on those areas that may have the greatest impact on us price our services appropriately and adjust our sales and operational approach in these areas  we have also developed educational materials for distribution to our clients and workers as well as client site visits to address specific safety risks unique to their industry  competition contingent staffing services the staffing industry is large and highly fragmented with large publicly held companies as well as privately owned companies on a national regional and local level  no single company has a dominant share of the industry  we compete primarily with local and regional companies  we also experience competition from internet based companies providing a variety of flexible workforce solutions  the strongest staffing services competitor in a particular market is a company with established relationships and a track record of meeting the client s needs  competition exists in attracting clients as well as qualified contingent workers  competitive forces have historically limited our ability to raise our prices to immediately and fully offset the increased costs of doing business some of which include increased contingent worker wages costs for workers compensation unemployment insurance and health care   page 8 table of contents the most significant competitive factors are price ability to promptly fill client orders success in meeting clients expectations of recruiting contingent workers and appropriately addressing client service issues  we believe we derive a competitive advantage from our service history our specialized approach in serving the industries of our clients and our mobile application jobstack which connects workers with jobs and creates a virtual exchange between our workers and clients  jobstack is helping to competitively differentiate our services expand our reach into new demographics and improve our recruiting sales and service delivery  our national presence industry specialization investment in technology and proprietary systems and processes together with specialized programs focused on worker safety risk management and legal and regulatory compliance are key differentiators from many of our competitors  human resource outsourcing the strongest competitors are companies specializing in rpo services and business process outsourcing companies that also offer rpo services  no one provider dominates the market  competition also includes internal human resource departments that have not or are not considering outsourcing  the most significant competitive factors for rpo services are the ability to reduce client cost by deploying an rpo solution and reducing the internal human resource cost structure of our clients  important factors for success in rpo services include the ability to add significant scalability to a client s recruiting and hiring efforts including accommodating seasonal and irregular hiring the ability to increase efficiency by standardizing processes and facilitating transitions for candidates and employees and the ability to source the most attractive talent at the best price  our tailored solutions client partnership proprietary technology and service delivery are key differentiators from many of our competitors  cyclical and seasonal nature of our business the workforce solutions business has historically been cyclical often acting as an indicator of both economic downturns and upswings  clients tend to use contingent workers to supplement their existing workforce and generally hire permanent workers when long term demand is expected to increase  as a consequence our revenue from services tends to increase quickly when the economy begins to grow  conversely our revenue from services decreases quickly when the economy begins to weaken and thus contingent staff positions are eliminated permanent hiring is frozen and turnover replacement diminishes  our business experiences seasonal fluctuations for contingent staffing services  demand is lower during the first and second quarters due in part to limitations to outside work during the winter months and slowdown in manufacturing and logistics after the holiday season  our working capital requirements are primarily driven by contingent worker payroll and client accounts receivable  since receipts from clients lag payroll to contingent workers working capital requirements increase substantially in periods of growth  demand for contingent labor peaks during the third quarter for outdoor work and the fourth quarter for manufacturing assembly warehousing distribution and logistics for the holiday season  regulation our services are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations  we continuously monitor legislation and regulatory changes for their potential effect on our business  we invest in technology and process improvements to implement required changes while minimizing the impact on our operating efficiency and effectiveness  regulatory cost increases are passed through to our clients to the fullest extent possible  financial information about geographic areas for information regarding revenue from operations and long lived assets by

risk factors investing in our securities involves risk  the following risk factors and all other information set forth in this annual report on form 10 k should be considered in evaluating our future prospects  if any of the events described below occur our business financial condition results of operations liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially and adversely affected  demand for our workforce solutions is significantly affected by fluctuations in general economic conditions  the demand for workforce solutions is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and the workforce needs of our clients which creates uncertainty and volatility  national and global economic activity is slowed by many factors including rising interest rates political and legislative changes epidemics other significant health concerns and global trade uncertainties  as economic activity slows companies tend to reduce their use of contingent workers and recruitment of new employees  for example we have recently experienced reduced demand from our construction and manufacturing customers  significant declines in demand of any region or industry in which we have a major presence reduces the demand for our services and thereby significantly decreases our revenues and profits  deterioration in economic conditions or the financial or credit markets could also have an adverse impact on our clients ability to pay for services we have already provided  it is difficult for us to forecast future demand for our services due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting the direction and strength of economic cycles and the project nature of our staffing assignments  the uncertainty can be exacerbated by volatile economic conditions which has caused and may continue to cause clients to reduce or defer projects for which they utilize our services  the negative impact to our business sometimes occurs before a decline in economic activity is seen in the broader economy  when it is difficult for us to accurately forecast future demand we may not be able to determine the optimal level of personnel and investment necessary to profitably take advantage of growth opportunities  we may be unable to attract sufficient qualified contingent workers and candidates to meet the needs of our clients  we compete to meet our clients needs for workforce solutions therefore we must continually attract qualified contingent workers and candidates to fill positions  attracting qualified workers and candidates depends on factors such as desirability of the assignment location the associated wages and other benefits  unemployment in the united states has been low in the past few years and has recently decreased further making it challenging to find sufficient eligible workers and candidates to meet our clients orders  further increases in employment rates could increase these difficulties  we have experienced shortages of qualified workers and candidates and may experience such shortages in the future  further if there is a shortage the cost to employ or recruit these individuals could increase and our ability to generate revenue would be harmed if we could not fill positions  if we are unable to pass those costs through to our clients it could materially and adversely affect our business  organized labor periodically engages in efforts to represent various groups of our contingent workers  if we are subject to unreasonable collective bargaining agreements or work disruptions our business could be adversely affected  we may not achieve the intended effects of our business strategy which could negatively impact our results  our business strategy focuses on driving growth in our peopleready peoplemanagement and peoplescout business lines by investing in innovative technology acquisitions and initiatives which drive organic growth  our investments and acquisitions may not achieve our desired returns and the results of our initiatives may not be as expected or may be impacted by matters outside of our control  if we are unsuccessful in executing any of these strategies we may not achieve our goal of revenue and profitability growth which could negatively impact financial results  our workforce solutions are subject to extensive government regulation and the imposition of additional regulations which could materially harm our future earnings  our workforce solutions are subject to extensive government regulation  the cost to comply and any inability to comply with government regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results  increases or changes in government regulation of the workplace or of the employer employee relationship or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation could materially harm our business  our temporary staffing services employ contingent workers  the wage rates we pay to contingent workers are based on many factors including government mandated minimum wage requirements payroll related taxes and benefits  if we are not able to increase the fees charged to clients to absorb any increased costs related to these factors our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected   page 10 table of contents we offer our contingent workers in the united states government mandated health insurance in compliance with the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the aca  because the requirements regulations and interpretations of the aca may change the ultimate financial effect of the aca is not yet known and changes in its requirements and interpretations could increase or change our costs  in addition because of the uncertainty surrounding a potential repeal or replacement of the aca we cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the aca s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on our financial condition or operating results  whether or not there is a change in health care legislation in the united states the costs of our health care expenditures may increase  if we are unable to comply with changes to the aca or any future health care legislation in the united states or sufficiently raise the rates we charge our clients to cover any additional costs such noncompliance or increases in costs could materially harm our business  we may experience employment related claims commercial indemnification claims and other legal proceedings that could materially harm our business  we are in the business of employing people in the workplaces of our clients  we incur a risk of liability for claims relating to personal injury wage and hour violations immigration discrimination harassment and other liabilities arising from the actions of our clients and or contingent workers  some or all of these claims may give rise to negative publicity investigations litigation or settlements  we may incur costs or other material adverse impacts on our financial statements for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated  we may have liability to our clients for the action or inactions of our employees that may cause harm to our clients or third parties  in some cases we must indemnify our clients for certain acts of our contingent workers or arising from our contingent workers presence on the client s job site and certain clients have negotiated broad indemnification provisions  we may also incur fines penalties and losses that are not covered by insurance or negative publicity with respect to these matters  we maintain insurance with respect to some potential claims and costs with deductibles  we cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future or that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms  should the final judgments or settlements exceed our insurance coverage they could have a material effect on our business  our ability to obtain insurance its coverage levels deductibles and premiums are all dependent on market factors our loss history and insurance providers assessments of our overall risk profile  further we cannot be certain our current and former insurance carriers will be able to pay claims we make under such policies  we are dependent on obtaining workers compensation and other insurance coverage at commercially reasonable terms  unexpected changes in claim trends on our workers compensation may negatively impact our financial condition  our temporary staffing services employ workers for which we provide workers compensation insurance  our workers compensation insurance policies are renewed annually  the majority of our insurance policies are with aig  our insurance carriers require us to collateralize a significant portion of our workers compensation obligation  the majority of collateral is held in trust by a third party for the payment of these claims  the loss or decline in value of the collateral could require us to seek additional sources of capital to pay our workers compensation claims  as our business grows or if our financial results deteriorate the amount of collateral required will likely increase and the timing of providing collateral could be accelerated  resources to meet these requirements may not be available  we cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future or that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms  the loss of our workers compensation insurance coverage would prevent us from operating as a staffing services business in the majority of our markets  further we cannot be certain that our current and former insurance carriers will be able to pay claims we make under such policies  we self insure or otherwise bear financial responsibility for a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation program  we have experienced unexpected changes in claim trends including the severity and frequency of claims changes in state laws regarding benefit levels and allowable claims actuarial estimates and medical cost inflation and may experience such changes in the future which could result in costs that are significantly different than initially anticipated or reported and could cause us to record different reserves in our financial statements  there is a risk that we will not be able to increase the fees charged to our clients in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any changes in claims related liabilities  we actively manage the safety of our contingent workers through our safety programs and actively control costs with our network of workers compensation related service providers  these activities have had a positive impact creating favorable adjustments to workers compensation liabilities recorded in prior periods  the benefit of these adjustments is likely to decline and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to reduce accident rates and control costs to produce these results in the future  some clients require extensive insurance coverage and request insurance endorsements that are not available under standard policies  there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate acceptable compromises with clients or negotiate appropriate page 11 table of contents changes in our insurance contracts  an inability to meet client insurance requirements may adversely affect our ability to take on new clients or continue providing services to existing clients  we operate in a highly competitive industry and may be unable to retain clients or market share  our industry is highly competitive and rapidly innovating with low barriers to entry  we compete in global national regional and local markets with full service and specialized temporary staffing companies as well as business process outsourcing companies that also offer our services  our competitors offer a variety of flexible workforce solutions  therefore there is no assurance that we will be able to retain clients or market share in the future nor can there be any assurance that we will in light of competitive pressures be able to remain profitable or maintain our current profit margins  advances in technology may disrupt the labor and recruiting markets and we must constantly improve our technology to meet the expectations of clients candidates and employees  the increased use of internet based and mobile technology is attracting additional technology oriented companies and resources to the staffing industry  our candidates and clients increasingly demand technological innovation to improve the access to and delivery of our services  our clients increasingly rely on automation artificial intelligence machine learning and other new technologies to reduce their dependence on labor needs which may reduce demand for our services and impact our operations  we face extensive pressure for lower prices and new service offerings and must continue to invest in and implement new technology and industry developments in order to remain relevant to our clients and candidates  as a result of this increasing dependence upon technology we must timely and effectively identify develop or license technology from third parties and integrate such enhanced or expanded technologies into the solutions that we provide  in addition our business relies on a variety of technologies including those that support recruiting hiring paying order management billing collecting contingent worker data analytics and client data analytics  if we do not sufficiently invest in and implement new technology or evolve our business at sufficient speed and scale our business results of operations may decline materially  acquiring technological expertise and developing new technologies for our business may require us to incur significant expenses and costs  for some solutions we depend on key vendors and partners to provide technology and support  if these third parties fail to perform their obligations or cease to work with us our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be negatively affected  our business and operations have undergone and will continue to undergo significant change as we seek to improve our operational and support effectiveness which if not managed could have an adverse outcome on our business and results of operations  we have significantly changed our operations and internal processes in recent periods and we will continue making similar changes in order to improve our operational effectiveness  these efforts strain our systems management administrative operations and financial infrastructure  for example we are currently combining some of our operating segments  we believe these efforts are important to our long term success  managing and cascading these changes throughout the company will continue to require the further attention of our management team and refinement to our operational financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures  these activities will require ongoing expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources  if we fail to manage these changes effectively our costs and expenses may increase more than we expect and our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed  we are at risk of damage to our brands and reputation which is important to our success  our ability to attract and retain clients contingent workers candidates and employees is affected by external perceptions of our brands and reputation  negative perceptions or publicity could damage our reputation with current or perspective clients and employees  negative perceptions or publicity regarding our vendors clients or business partners may adversely affect our brand and reputation  we may not be successful in detecting preventing or negating all changes in or impacts on our reputation  if any factor including poor performance or negative publicity whether or not true hurts our reputation we may experience negative repercussions which could harm our business  the expansion of social media platforms creates new risks and challenges that could cause damage to our brand and reputation   the use of social media platforms including social media websites and other forms of internet based communications has rapidly increased allowing individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested parties  for example unfavorable comments about a work site could make recruiting or hiring at that site more challenging  the inappropriate or unauthorized use of such platforms by our clients or employees could violate privacy laws cause damage to our brand or lead to litigation which could harm our business   page 12 table of contents our level of debt and restrictions in our credit agreement could negatively affect our operations and limit our liquidity and our ability to react to changes in the economy  extensions of credit under our revolving credit agreement revolving credit facility are limited  our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that require us to maintain certain financial conditions  our failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could require us to repay these borrowings before their due date  we may not have sufficient funds on hand to repay these loans and if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance at all our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by increased costs and rates  our principal sources of liquidity are funds generated from operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  we must have sufficient sources of liquidity to meet our working capital requirements fund our workers compensation collateral requirements service our outstanding indebtedness and finance investment opportunities  without sufficient liquidity we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue promising business opportunities  in the event that our debt levels increase it could have significant consequences for the operation of our business including requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing our debt rather than using it for our operations limiting our ability to obtain additional debt financing for future working capital capital expenditures or other corporate purposes limiting our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisitions limiting our ability to react to changes in market or industry conditions and putting us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt  the loss of continued reduction or substantial decline in revenue from larger clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues profitability and liquidity  we experience revenue concentration with large clients  generally our contracts do not contain guarantees of minimum duration revenue levels or profitability  our clients may terminate their contracts or materially reduce their requested levels of service at any time  although we have no clients that represents over 10 of our consolidated revenue there are clients that exceed 10 of revenues within some of our operating segments  the deterioration of the financial condition of a large client could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  in addition a significant change to the business staffing or recruiting model of these clients for example a decision to insource our services has had and could again have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  the loss of or reduced demand for our services from larger clients has had and in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  client concentration exposes us to concentrated credit risk as a significant portion of our accounts receivable may be from a small number of clients  if we are unable to collect our receivables or are required to take additional reserves our results and cash flows will be adversely affected  failure of our information technology systems could adversely affect our operating results  the efficient operation of our business and applications and services we provide is dependent on reliable technology  we rely on our information technology systems to monitor and control our operations adjust to changing market conditions implement strategic initiatives and provide services to clients  we rely heavily on proprietary and third party information technology systems mobile device technology data centers cloud based environments and other technology  we take various precautions and have enhanced controls around these systems but information technology systems are susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases power outages hardware failures computer viruses malicious attacks telecommunication failures user errors or catastrophic events  the failure of technology and our applications and services and our information systems to perform as anticipated could disrupt our business and result in decreased revenue and increased overhead costs causing our business and results of operations to suffer materially  cyber security vulnerabilities and incidents could lead to the improper disclosure of information about our clients candidates and employees  our business requires the use processing and storage of confidential information about applicants candidates contingent workers other employees and clients  we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out operational and support activities and maintain our business records  we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients partners and employees  the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure increases the potential risk of security breaches which could lead to potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information   page 13 table of contents our systems and networks are vulnerable to computer viruses malware hackers and other security issues including physical and electronic break ins disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering social engineering attacks impersonation of authorized users and coordinated denial of services attacks  we have experienced cyber security incidents and attacks which have not had a material impact on our business or results of operations however there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future  the security controls over sensitive or confidential information and other practices we and our third party vendors follow may not prevent the improper access to disclosure of or loss of such information  continued investments in cyber security will increase our costs and a failure to prevent access to our systems could lead to penalties litigation and damage to our reputation  perceptions that we do not adequately protect the privacy of information could harm our relationship with clients and employees  data security data privacy and data protection laws and other technology regulations increase our costs  laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection are evolving and generally becoming more stringent  we may fail to implement practices and procedures that comply with increasing international and domestic privacy regulations such as the general data protection regulations or the california consumer privacy act  several additional u s  states have issued cyber security regulations that outline a variety of required security measures for protection of data  these regulations are designed to protect client candidate contingent worker and employee data and require that we meet stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data including the use protection and transfer of personal data  as these laws continue to change we may be required to make changes to our services solutions or products to meet the new legal requirements  changes in these laws may increase our costs to comply as well as our potential costs through higher potential penalties for non compliance  failure to protect the integrity and security of such confidential and or proprietary information could expose us to regulatory fines litigation contractual liability damage to our reputation and increased compliance costs  improper disclosure of or access to our clients information could materially harm our business  our contingent workers and employees may have access to or exposure to confidential information about applicants candidates contingent workers other employees and clients  the security controls over sensitive or confidential information and other practices we our clients and our third party vendors follow may not prevent the improper access to disclosure of or loss of such information  failure to protect the integrity and security of such confidential and or proprietary information could expose us to regulatory fines litigation contractual liability damage to our reputation and increased compliance costs  failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  we have invested in developing specialized technology and intellectual property proprietary systems processes and methodologies that we believe provide us a competitive advantage in serving clients  we cannot guarantee that trade secrets trademark and copyright law protections are adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property which is an important part of our business  we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights  we cannot be sure that our services and products or the products of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or our clients  these claims may harm our reputation result in financial liability and prevent us from offering some services or products to clients  our facilities operations and information technology systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption  our primary computer systems headquarters support facilities and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses employee errors security breaches natural disasters and catastrophic events  failure of our systems or damage to our facilities may cause significant interruption to our business and require significant additional capital and management resources to resolve causing material harm to our business  acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our business  we may continue making acquisitions a part of our business strategy  this strategy may be impeded however and we may not achieve our long term growth goals if we cannot identify suitable acquisition candidates or if acquisition candidates are not available under acceptable terms  we may have difficulty integrating acquired companies into our operating financial planning and financial reporting systems and may not effectively manage acquired companies to achieve expected growth  future acquisitions could result in incurring additional debt and contingent liabilities an increase in interest expense amortization expense and charges related to integration costs  additional indebtedness could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations  we may also issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition which could result in dilution to our shareholders  any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by investors which may adversely affect the price of our common stock  acquisitions can also result in the addition of goodwill and intangible assets to our financial statements and we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which we determine page 14 table of contents an impairment of our acquired goodwill and intangible assets has occurred which would negatively impact our financial results  the potential loss of key executives employees clients suppliers vendors and other business partners of businesses we acquire may adversely impact the value of the assets operations or business we acquire  these events could cause material harm to our business operating results or financial condition  new business initiatives may have an adverse effect on our business   we expect to continue adjusting the composition of our business lines and entering into new business initiatives as part of our business strategy  new business initiatives strategic business partners or changes in the composition of our business mix can be distracting to our management and disruptive to our operations causing our business and results of operations to suffer materially  new business initiatives including initiatives outside of our workforce solutions business in new markets or new geographies could involve significant unanticipated challenges and risks including not advancing our business strategy not realizing our anticipated return on investment experiencing difficulty in implementing initiatives or diverting management s attention from our other businesses  these events could cause material harm to our business operating results or financial condition  our results of operations could materially deteriorate if we fail to attract develop and retain qualified employees  our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining qualified employees who are able to meet the needs of our clients  we believe our competitive advantage is providing unique solutions for each client which requires us to have trained and engaged employees  our success depends upon our ability to attract develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including management sales recruiting service technology and administrative personnel  the turnover rate in the employment services industry is high and qualified individuals may be difficult to attract and hire  our inability to recruit train and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals may delay or affect the speed and quality of our strategy execution and planned growth  delayed expansion significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  we may have additional tax liabilities that exceed our estimates  we are subject to federal taxes a multitude of state and local taxes in the united states and taxes in foreign jurisdictions  we face continued uncertainty surrounding the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act and any reduction or change in tax credits which we utilize such as the work opportunity tax credit  in the ordinary course of our business there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain  we are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities  although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals  the results of an audit or litigation with tax authorities could materially harm our business  changes in interpretation of existing laws and regulations by a taxing authority could result in penalties and increased costs in the future  the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing intercompany arrangements or may change their laws which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations  the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly which may result in losses for investors  the market price for our common stock may be subject to significant volatility  our stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control  these factors include but are not limited to changes in general economic conditions announcement of new services or acquisitions by us or our competitors changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts changes in industry trends or conditions regulatory developments and any major change in our board or management  in addition the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of listed companies  these broad market and industry factors may impact the price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance  we cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program or that our share repurchase program will enhance long term shareholder value  our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program  under the program we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock for a set aggregate purchase price and we may choose to purchase shares in the open market from individual holders through an accelerated share repurchase program or otherwise  although the board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program the share repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares  the timing and amount of the repurchases if any will depend upon several factors including market and business conditions the trading price of the company s common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities  the repurchase program may be limited suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice  in addition repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility  the existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and page 15 table of contents could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock  additionally our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions  there can be no assurance that these share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the level at which we repurchased shares of stock  although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long term shareholder value there is no assurance that it will do so and short term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program s effectiveness  failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting  if our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls including those over our third party vendors or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence  in addition if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel processes and controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis which could cause our stock price to fall  outsourcing certain aspects of our business could result in disruption and increased costs  we have outsourced certain aspects of our business to third party vendors  these relationships subject us to risks including disruptions in our business and increased costs  for example we license software from third parties much of which is central to our systems and our business  the licenses are generally terminable if we breach our obligations under the license agreements  if any of these relationships were terminated or if any of these parties were to cease doing business or supporting the applications we currently utilize we may be forced to spend significant time and money to replace the licensed software  in addition we have engaged third parties to host and manage certain aspects of our data center information and technology infrastructure mobile applications and electronic pay solutions to provide certain back office support activities and to support business process outsourcing for our clients  we are subject to the risks associated with the vendors inability to provide these services in a manner that meets our needs  if the cost of these services is more than expected if we or the vendors fail to adequately protect our data and information is lost or if our ability to deliver our services is interrupted then our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted  we face risks in operating internationally  a portion of our business operations and support functions are located outside of the united states  these international operations are subject to a number of risks including political and economic conditions in those foreign countries foreign currency fluctuations the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards unpredictable changes in foreign regulations u s  legal requirements governing u s  companies operating in foreign countries legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations  we recently acquired operations in the united kingdom which could be negatively impacted as clients in the united kingdom encounter uncertainties related to the united kingdom s exit from the european union  we could also be exposed to fines and penalties under u s  or foreign laws for instance the foreign corrupt practices act prohibiting improper payments to governmental officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business  although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws we cannot be sure that our employees contractors or agents will not violate such policies  any such violations could materially damage our reputation brands business and operating results  further changes in u s  laws and policies governing foreign investment and use of foreign operations or workers and any negative sentiments towards the united states resulting from such changes could adversely affect our operations  item 1b  unresolved staff comments not applicable  item 2  properties we lease building space for all our peopleready branches except for two that we own in florida and our

a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to our financial statements  overview trueblue inc   the company trueblue we us and our is a leading provider of specialized workforce solutions that help clients achieve business growth and improve productivity  in 2019 we connected approximately 724 000 people with work and served approximately 139 000 clients  we report our business as three reportable segments peopleready peoplemanagement and peoplescout  our peopleready segment offers on demand industrial staffing peoplemanagement segment offers contingent on site industrial staffing and commercial driver services and peoplescout segment offers recruitment process outsourcing rpo and managed service provider msp solutions to a wide variety of industries  see note 16 segment information to our consolidated financial statements found in item 8 of this annual report on form 10 k for additional details on our operating and reportable segments  we experienced challenges in fiscal 2019 evidenced by a 5 2 revenue decline and a 4 1 decline in net income  some of the decline in revenue was expected and came from a small number of large clients that experienced issues within their businesses  as the year unfolded we saw a broader softening in revenue trends similar to other industrial staffing providers as clients pulled back in response to lower volumes  while overall job data was positive for the united states the contingent portion which makes up approximately 2 of the workforce experienced a pull back as businesses used contingent services more sparingly in light of economic uncertainty  fiscal 2019 highlights revenue from services total company revenue declined 5 2 to 2 4 billion for the year ended december 29 2019 compared to the prior year  this decline was primarily driven by less demand for our services attributable to lower volumes within the businesses of our clients and continued economic uncertainty  revenue trends slowed over the course of the year as clients moderated contingent labor spend  declines were broad based across multiple geographies and industries with manufacturing experiencing the most pressure  peopleready our largest segment experienced a revenue decline of 3 2 due primarily to less demand for our services and continued economic uncertainty  peoplemanagement our lowest margin segment experienced a revenue decline of 11 8  in addition to less demand from existing clients peoplemanagement experienced the impact of the loss of several key clients in the prior year  peoplescout our highest margin segment experienced revenue growth of 1 4  our year over year peoplescout trends are impacted by our acquisition on june 12 2018 of tmp holdings ltd tmp  the tmp acquisition contributed 9 9 growth to peoplescout for the year ended december 29 2019 compared to the prior year  in addition to less demand from existing clients peoplescout continues to experience the impact of the loss of a large client after being acquired in the first quarter of 2019 and lower volume and margin on another large industrial client due to adverse business conditions  gross profit total company gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 29 2019 was 26 4 compared to 26 6 for the prior year  the decrease was primarily due to client mix partially offset by a decrease to workers compensation cost  selling general and administrative sg a expense total company sg a expense decreased by 29 million to 522 million or 22 1 of revenue for the year ended december 29 2019 compared to 551 million or 22 0 of revenue for the prior year  the decrease in sg a expense is primarily due to cost control programs while remaining committed to investing in customer acquisition and retention initiatives to drive growth and our digital strategies to differentiate our services and grow market share   page 21 table of contents management s discussion and analysis income from operations total company income from operations was 66 million or 2 8 of revenue for the year ended december 29 2019 compared to 74 million or 3 0 of revenue for the prior year  the decrease in gross profit from the decline in revenue was largely offset by the decrease in sg a expense due to cost control programs  net income was 63 million 2 7 of revenue or 1 61 per diluted share for the year ended december 29 2019 compared to 66 million 2 6 of revenue or 1 63 per diluted share for the prior year  the net income decline was primarily driven by declining income from operations partially offset by lower interest expense due to a lower debt balance of 37 million at the end of 2019 compared to 80 million at the end of 2018  additional highlights we believe we are taking the right steps with our disciplined cost management to address the continued economic uncertainty and slowed contingent labor spend while investing in strategic growth initiatives to produce long term growth for shareholders  we also believe we are in a strong financial position to fund working capital needs for growth opportunities  as of december 29 2019 we had cash and cash equivalents of 38 million and 257 million available under our revolving credit agreement revolving credit facility for total liquidity of 295 million  we continue to return cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program  we repurchased 39 million of common stock during the fiscal year ended december 29 2019 which leaves 119 million available under the existing

general and skilled labor  peopleready connects people to work in a broad range of industries that include construction manufacturing and logistics warehousing and distribution waste and recycling energy retail hospitality and others  peopleready helped approximately 138 000 clients in fiscal 2019 to be more productive by providing easy access to dependable blue collar contingent labor  through our peopleready service line we connected approximately 317 000 people with work in fiscal 2019  we have a network of 614 branches across all 50 states canada and puerto rico  complementing our branch network is our mobile application jobstack tm which connects workers with jobs creates a virtual exchange between our workers and clients and allows our branch resources to expand their recruiting and sales efforts and service delivery  jobstack is helping to competitively differentiate our services expand our reach into new demographics and improve both service delivery and work order fill rates as we lead our business into a digital future   peoplemanagement predominantly provides a wide range of on site contingent staffing and workforce management solutions to larger multi site manufacturing distribution and fulfillment clients  in comparison with peopleready services are larger in scale longer in duration and dedicated service teams are located at the client s facility  effective december 30 2019 first day of our 2020 fiscal year we combined our two on site contingent industrial workforce operating segments staff management smx staff management and simos insourcing solutions simos into one operating segment titled on site which continues to be reported under peoplemanagement  on site includes our branded service offerings for hourly and productivity based industrial staffing solutions serving the same industries and similar customers  peoplemanagement also includes centerline drivers centerline which specializes in dedicated and contingent commercial truck drivers to the transportation and distribution industries  effective march 12 2018 we divested the planetechs llc planetechs business from our peoplemanagement reportable segment   peoplescout provides recruitment process outsourcing of end to end talent acquisition services from candidate sourcing and engagement through the onboarding of employees  our solution is highly scalable and flexible which allows for the outsourcing of all or a subset of skill categories across a series of recruitment hiring and onboarding steps  our solution delivers improved talent quality and candidate experience faster hiring increased scalability lower cost of recruitment greater flexibility and increased compliance  our clients outsource the recruitment process to peoplescout in all major industries and jobs  we leverage our proprietary technology platform affinix tm for sourcing screening and delivering a permanent workforce along with dedicated service delivery teams to work as an integrated partner with our clients  affinix uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to search the web and source candidates which means we can create the first slate of candidates for a job posting within minutes rather than days  our year over year trends are impacted by our acquisition on june 12 2018 of tmp a mid sized rpo and employer branding services provider operating in the united kingdom which is the second largest rpo market in the world  this acquisition increases our ability to win multi continent engagements by adding a physical presence in europe referenceable clients and employer branding capabilities  this acquisition expands and complements our peoplescout services and has been integrated into this operating segment  our peoplescout reportable segment also includes a managed service provider business which provides clients with improved quality and spend management of their contingent labor vendors  global employment trends are reshaping and redefining traditional employment models sourcing strategies and human resource capability requirements due to changing demographics worker shortages employee preferences and employer workforce needs  in response the staffing industry has accelerated its evolution from commercial staffing into specialized and outsourced staffing solutions  client demand for staffing services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and trends toward greater workforce flexibility  improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor resulting in greater demand for our staffing services  this may create volatility based on overall economic conditions   page 23 table of contents management s discussion and analysis revenue from services revenue from services by

year  the revenue decline was primarily due to less demand for our services attributable to lower volumes within the businesses of our clients and continued economic uncertainty  revenue trends slowed over the course of the year as clients moderated contingent labor spend  declines were broad based across multiple geographies and industries  we believe the decline was partially offset by the strategic use of our industry leading jobstack mobile application that digitally connects workers with jobs  during fiscal 2019 peopleready dispatched 4 million shifts via jobstack and achieved a digital fill rate of 48  the mobile application is used by 21 300 clients with 87 worker adoption which is up 8 7 and 62 6 respectively compared to the prior year  wage growth has accelerated due to various minimum wage increases and a need for higher wages to attract talent in tight labor markets  we have increased bill rates for the higher wages payroll burdens and our traditional mark ups  while we believe our pricing strategy is the right long term decision these actions can have an impact on our revenue trends in the near term  peoplemanagement revenue declined to 642 million for the year ended december 29 2019 an 11 8 decrease compared to the prior year  the decline included 3 3 from the loss of amazon s canadian business in the second half of 2018 when they insourced the recruitment and management of contingent labor for their warehouse fulfillment centers 2 1 from the substantially reduced volumes and price reductions with a large existing retail client and 1 1 from the divestiture of our planetechs business in mid march 2018  the remaining decline of 5 3 was primarily due to slowing demand attributable to lower volumes within the business of our existing clients and continued economic uncertainty  peoplescout revenue grew to 252 million for the year ended december 29 2019 an 1 4 increase compared to the prior year  the increase was due primarily to the acquisition of tmp during the second quarter of 2018 which represents a 9 9 increase in peoplescout s revenue for the year ended december 29 2019 compared to the prior year  revenue growth was constrained primarily due to the loss of one large client after being acquired by a strategic buyer in the prior year and substantially reduced project based recruiting volumes at another large client which declined throughout the year due to adverse business conditions resulting in no order volume in the fourth quarter of 2019   page 24 table of contents management s discussion and analysis gross

to 26 4 for the year ended december 29 2019 compared to 26 6 for the prior year  the decline was primarily due to client mix which was partially offset by lower workers compensation costs  the lower workers compensation costs of 0 2 was from additional insurance coverage in our staffing business associated with former workers compensation carriers that are in liquidation  this was due to improvements in their balance sheets which allowed these carriers to cover a larger proportion of outstanding claims  improvements to the gross margin of our staffing businesses were more than offset by declines to the peoplescout gross margin primarily due to the lower margins associated with the acquired tmp business due to the pass through nature of recruitment media purchases made on behalf of certain clients the loss of one large client after being acquired by a strategic buyer in the prior year and substantially reduced project based recruiting volumes at another large client due to adverse business conditions  we continue to manage the rising cost of claims by reducing workplace accidents  continued favorable adjustments to our workers compensation liabilities are dependent on

971 9 909 effective income tax rate 10 0 13 1 our tax provision and our effective tax rate are subject to variation due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting our pre tax and taxable income and loss by jurisdiction tax credits government audit developments changes in laws regulations and administrative practices and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized  additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre tax income  for example the impact of tax credits and non deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre tax income is lower  our effective tax rate for the year ended december 29 2019 was 10 0 compared to 13 1 for the prior year  a significant driver of fluctuations in our effective income tax rate is the work opportunity tax credit wotc  wotc is designed to encourage hiring of workers from certain disadvantaged targeted categories and is generally calculated as a percentage of wages over a twelve month period up to worker maximums by targeted category  based on historical results and business trends we estimate the amount of wotc we expect to earn related to wages of the current year  however the estimate is subject to variation because 1 a small percentage of our workers qualify for one or more of the many targeted categories 2 the targeted categories are subject to different incentive credit rates and limitations 3 credits fluctuate depending on economic conditions and qualified worker retention periods and 4 state and federal offices can delay their credit certification processing and have inconsistent certification rates  we recognize additional prior year job credits if credits in excess of original estimates have been certified by government offices  wotc was extended through december 31 2020 as a result of the further consolidated appropriations act of 2020 h r  1865  approval from congress will be required to

however we believe there is value in providing highlights of our expectations for future financial performance  the following highlights represent our expectations regarding operating trends for fiscal 2020  these expectations are subject to revision as our business changes with the overall economy   we expect additional pressure on our revenue trends in 2020 due primarily to a widespread decline in same client demand as clients continue to experience weaker volumes within their own businesses across most geographies and industries  peopleready our largest segment experienced year over year revenue declines in 2019 and experienced growing revenue pressure as the year progressed  similar to peopleready peoplemanagement our lowest margin segment experienced less demand from existing clients and continued economic uncertainty  peoplescout our highest margin segment passed the one year anniversary of the tmp acquisition in june 2019  peoplescout will experience further pressure due to the continued impact of the loss of a key client that was acquired by a strategic buyer which will anniversary in the first quarter of 2020 and substantially reduced project based recruiting volumes at another large industrial client due to adverse business conditions which will anniversary in the third quarter of 2020  we expect continued challenges in the industrial markets we serve but we are encouraged by recent improvements in the demand trend for peopleready services   we believe there is a changing pace of underlying economic activity in some of the industries we serve  our belief is based on our same client revenue trends and the softening demand for our peopleready services  given the project based nature of peopleready s business we believe it is often an early indicator of changing demand patterns  we remain focused on client expansion and retention disciplined cost management and investing in our digital strategies to differentiate our service offerings   we are committed to technological innovation to transform our business for a digital future that makes it easier for our clients to do business with us and easier to connect people to work  we continue making investments in online and mobile applications to improve access to workers and candidates as well as improve the speed and ease of connecting our clients and workers for our staffing businesses and candidates for our recruitment process outsourcing business  we expect these investments will increase the competitive differentiation of our services over the long term improve the efficiency of our service delivery and reduce our peopleready dependence on local branches to find contingent workers and connect them with work  examples include our new jobstack mobile application in the peopleready business and our affinix talent acquisition technology in our peoplescout business  peopleready s jobstack app has filled more than six million shifts since its inception and is currently filling a job every nine seconds  peoplescout s affinix is helping clients improve time to fill candidate flow and candidate satisfaction  we believe our digital strategies provide further

adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 were primarily due to depreciation and amortization decreased primarily due to certain fixed assets and intangible assets becoming fully depreciated during the prior year  additionally a greater portion of our investment funds are being directed toward non capitalized third party cloud based solutions   provision for doubtful accounts decreased primarily due to the overall reduction in revenue during fiscal 2019  additionally 2019 benefited from the recovery of receivables which had been reserved for in 2018 when a customer filed for bankruptcy protection   stock based compensation decreased primarily due to 4 million of accelerated stock compensation costs associated with the ceo transition in fiscal 2018  changes to operating assets and liabilities net of amounts acquired and divested for fiscal 2019 were primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the decline in revenue due to less demand for our services attributable to lower volumes within the businesses of our clients  this was partially offset by higher days sales outstanding due to continued economic uncertainty and longer payment terms   the increase in income tax receivable in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to delays in foreign jurisdiction processing of refunds and higher than expected wotc benefits   change in all other assets decreased primarily due to unrealized gains on deferred compensation assets as both equity and bond markets strengthened into fiscal 2019 verses unrealized losses in fiscal 2018 after a sharp decline in equity markets in the fourth quarter of 2018   generally our workers compensation claims reserve for estimated claims decreases as contingent labor services declines as is the case in the current and prior year  additionally our worker safety programs have had a positive impact and have created favorable adjustments to our workers

operations discusses our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period  on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments  management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to understand and evaluate our reported financial results and they require management s most subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain   page 34 table of contents management s discussion and analysis workers compensation reserve we maintain reserves for workers compensation claims including the excess claims portion above our deductible using actuarial estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses  these estimates include claims that have been reported but not settled and claims that have been incurred but not reported  these reserves which reflect potential liabilities to be paid in future periods based on estimated payment patterns are discounted to estimated net present value using discount rates based on average returns on risk free u s  treasury instruments which are evaluated on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the reserves regularly throughout the year and make adjustments accordingly  if the actual cost of such claims and related expenses exceed the amount estimated additional reserves may be required  changes in reserve estimates are reflected in cost of services on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income in the period when the changes in estimates are made  our workers compensation reserves include estimated expenses related to excess claims and a corresponding receivable for the insurance coverage on excess claims based on the contractual policy agreements we have with insurance companies  we discount the reserve and its corresponding receivable to their estimated net present values using the risk free rates associated with the actuarially determined weighted average lives of our excess claims  when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against the insurance receivable to reflect amounts that may not be realized  there are two main factors that impact workers compensation cost the number of claims and the cost per claim  the number of claims is driven by the volume of hours worked the business mix which reflects the type of work performed and the safety of the environment where the work is performed  the cost per claim is driven primarily by the severity of the injury the state in which the injury occurs related medical costs and lost time wage costs  a 5 change in one or more of the above factors would result in a change to workers compensation cost of approximately 4 million  our reserve balances have been positively impacted primarily by the success of our accident prevention programs  in the event that we are not able to further reduce our accident rates the positive impacts to our reserve balance will diminish  allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated probable losses resulting from the failure of our clients to make required payments  the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical write off experience expectations of future write offs and current economic data and represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses  the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and past due balances are written off when it is likely the receivable will not be collected  if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required  business combinations we account for our business acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting  the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  we determine the estimated fair values after review and consideration of relevant information including discounted cash flows quoted market prices and estimates made by management  determining the fair value of an acquired company is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  the significant judgments include estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on forecasts estimation of the long term rate of growth estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of a weighted average cost of capital which is risk adjusted to reflect the specific risk profile of the business being purchased  intangible assets that arise from contractual legal rights or are capable of being separated are measured and recorded at fair value and amortized over the estimated useful life  if practicable assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies are measured and recorded at fair value  if not practicable such assets and liabilities are measured and recorded when it is probable that a gain or loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated  the residual balance of the purchase price after fair value allocations to all identified assets and liabilities represents goodwill  goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit s expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date  acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred  our acquisitions may include contingent consideration which require us to recognize the fair value of the estimated liability at the time of the acquisition  subsequent changes in the estimate of the amount to be paid under the contingent consideration arrangement are recognized on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  cash payments for contingent or deferred consideration are classified within cash flows from investing activities for the purchase price fair value of the contingent consideration while amounts paid in excess are classified within cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows   page 35 table of contents management s discussion and analysis goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of the first day of our fiscal second quarter and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred  these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition client engagement or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit  we monitor the existence of potential impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year  goodwill we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level  we consider our operating segments to be our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing  as of december 29 2019 our operating segments are peopleready centerline staff management simos peoplescout and peoplescout msp  the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill  fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit  if the fair value exceeds the carrying value we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of the goodwill  determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions to evaluate the impact of operational and macroeconomic changes on each reporting unit  the fair value of each reporting unit is a weighted average of the income and market valuation approaches  the income approach applies a fair value methodology based on discounted cash flows  this analysis requires significant estimates and judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital which is risk adjusted to reflect the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested  we also apply a market approach which identifies similar publicly traded companies and develops a correlation referred to as a multiple to apply to the operating results of the reporting units  the primary market multiples to which we compare are revenue and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization  the income and market approaches were equally weighted in our most recent annual impairment test  these combined fair values are reconciled to our aggregate market value of our shares of common stock outstanding on the date of valuation  we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain  actual future results may differ from those estimates  we consider a reporting unit s fair value to be substantially in excess of its carrying value at a 20 premium or greater  annual impairment test based on our 2019 annual impairment test the estimated fair value of all our reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying value except our simos reporting unit which was in excess of its carrying value by approximately 10  the current carrying value of goodwill for this reporting unit is 35 million  there are two key clients that individually account for more than 10 of revenue for the simos reporting unit  for each client we service multiple sites  the loss of a key client loss of a significant number of key sites or a significant downturn in the economy could give rise to an impairment  should any one of these events occur we may need to record an impairment loss to goodwill for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit s fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill  a discount rate of 12 5 was used in calculating the fair value of this reporting unit  in the event that the discount rate increases by approximately 1 percentage point the forecasted revenue growth rate declines by approximately 3 percentage points or gross margin as a percentage of revenue declines by approximately 1 percentage point the carrying value of the reporting unit would have exceeded its fair value  should any one of these events occur we may need to record an impairment loss to goodwill for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit s fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill  our weighted average cost of capital for all our reporting units ranged from 11 5 to 12 5 and our control premium was 15 2 which management has determined to be reasonable  interim impairment test effective december 30 2019 the first day of fiscal 2020 our simos and staff management smx reporting units were combined into one reporting unit on site due to common customers and contingent workers similar nature of services and economic characteristics  therefore we tested the simos reporting unit for impairment prior to the combination due to its sensitivity to impairment as of our annual impairment test as explained above  our smx reporting unit s fair value was substantially in excess of its carrying as of the annual impairment test or approximately 48 and there were no indicators of impairment during the interim period  therefore no interim impairment test was performed  based on the interim impairment test of our simos reporting unit the estimated fair value was in excess of its carrying value by approximately 7  a discount rate of 12 0 was used in calculating the fair value of this reporting unit  if the discount rate was approximately 1 percentage point higher the forecasted page 36 table of contents management s discussion and analysis revenue growth rate was approximately 5 percentage points lower or gross margin as a percentage of revenue was approximately 1 percentage point lower the carrying value of the reporting unit would have exceeded its fair value  based on the results of our annual and interim impairment tests there was no impairment loss recognized for the year ended december 29 2019  based on our 2018 and 2017 annual impairment tests all reporting units fair values were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values  accordingly there was no impairment loss recognized for the years ended december 30 2018 or december 31 2017  indefinite lived intangible assets we have indefinite lived intangible assets related to our staff management and peoplescout trade names  we test our trade names annually for impairment and when indicators of potential impairment exist  we utilize the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of each of our trade names  if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value  management uses considerable judgment to determine key assumptions including projected revenue royalty rates and appropriate discount rates  we performed our annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test for 2019 2018 and 2017 and determined that the estimated fair values exceeded the carrying amounts for our indefinite lived trade names  accordingly no impairment loss was recognized for the years ended december 29 2019 december 30 2018 or december 31 2017  finite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets we review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long lived assets whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable  factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to historical or planned operating results or significant changes in business strategies  we estimate the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate  an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset  when an impairment loss is recognized the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation techniques  no impairment loss was recognized for the years ended december 29 2019 december 30 2018 or december 31 2017  estimated contingent legal and regulatory liabilities from time to time we are subject to compliance audits by federal state and local authorities relating to a variety of regulations including wage and hour laws taxes workers compensation immigration and safety  we are also subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our operations  we have established reserves for contingent legal and regulatory liabilities  we record a liability when our management determines that it is probable that a legal claim will result in an adverse outcome and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated  to the extent that an insurance company or other third party is legally obligated to reimburse us for a liability we record a receivable for the amount of the probable reimbursement  we evaluate our estimated liability regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed  if the actual outcome of these matters is different than expected an adjustment is charged or credited to expense in the period the outcome occurs or the period in which the estimate changes  income taxes and related valuation allowances we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  we measure these expected future tax consequences based upon the provisions of tax law as currently enacted the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated  future tax law changes such as changes to federal and state corporate tax rates and the mix of states and their taxable income could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations  when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized  in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events and past operating results  new accounting standards see note 1 summary of significant

interest on our long term debt is based on the london interbank offered rate libor  in the event libor is replaced trueblue has agreed with its lenders to adopt a successor rate benchmark  trust assets restricted cash and investments consist principally of collateral that has been provided or pledged to insurance carriers for workers compensation and state workers compensation programs  our insurance carriers and certain state workers compensation programs require us to collateralize a portion of the workers compensation obligation  the collateral typically takes the form of cash and cash equivalents and highly rated investment grade securities primarily in municipal debt securities corporate debt securities and agency mortgage backed securities  the majority of our collateral obligations are held in a trust trust at the bank of new york mellon  the individual investments within the trust are subject to credit risk due to possible rating changes default or impairment  we monitor the portfolio to ensure this risk does not exceed prudent levels  we consistently apply and adhere to our investment policy of holding high quality diversified securities  we have the positive intent and ability to hold these investments until maturity and accordingly have classified them as held to maturity  for additional information see note 4 restricted cash and investments to the

revolving credit facility which bears interest at variable rates  for additional information see note 8 long term debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10 k  based on the principal balance of our outstanding revolving credit facility of 37 million as of december 29 2019 an increase or decrease of the interest rate by 10 over the next year would not have a material effect on our annual interest expense  foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our revenue expense liabilities and capital purchasing activities are transacted in u s  dollars  however because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the united states we have minimal transactions in other currencies primarily the canadian and australian dollars and great britain pound  we have not hedged our foreign currency translation risk  we have the ability to hold our foreign currency denominated assets indefinitely and do not expect that a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates will have a material impact on future operating results or cash flows   page 38 table of contents item 8  financial statements and supplementary

to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u s  federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob  we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob  those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement whether due to error or fraud  our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks  such procedures included examining on a test basis evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements  our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements  we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion  critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements

note 6 to the financial statements critical audit matter description the company s evaluation of the simos insourcing solutions reporting unit simos goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the estimated reporting unit fair value to its carrying value  the company equally weighted the discounted cash flow model and market approach to estimate fair value which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues and earnings  changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value the amount of any goodwill impairment charge or both  the total goodwill balance as of december 29 2019 the measurement date allocated to simos was 35 million  the estimated fair value of simos exceeded its carrying value by approximately 7 as of the measurement date  based on the fact that the estimated fair value of the simos reporting unit exceeded the carrying values no impairment was recognized   page 39 table of contents given the nature of simos operations the method used to determine its fair value and the difference between its fair value and carrying value auditing management s judgments regarding forecasts of future revenue and cash flows for simos involved enhanced auditor judgment  how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our audit procedures related to forecasts of future revenue and earnings for the simos reporting unit included the following among others we tested the effectiveness of controls over management s evaluation of goodwill for impairment including those over the forecast of future revenue and earnings   we evaluated management s ability to accurately forecast future revenues and earnings by comparing actual results to management s historical forecasts   we evaluated the reasonableness of management s revenue and earnings forecast by comparing the forecasts to historical revenues and earnings and internal communications between management brand presidents and the board of directors including assessment of current and future growth opportunities   we further evaluated the reasonableness of management s forecast by evaluating alternative assumptions about future revenue and cash flows using both the company s internal information and analyst and industry reports  workers compensation claims reserves refer to note 1 and note 7 to the financial statements critical audit matter description the company bears the financial responsibility for a significant portion of expected losses under its workers compensation program and records reserves for workers compensation claims based on estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses which are discounted to their estimated net present value  the determination of the undiscounted reserves requires significant estimates and assumptions related to the future cost of claims and related expenses for claims that have been reported but not settled as well as those that have been incurred but not reported  the undiscounted workers compensation obligation was 274 9 million as of december 29 2019  given the fact that changes in actuarial assumptions could have a significant impact on the reserves auditing management judgments regarding the workers compensation reserves including estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses involved a high degree of auditor judgment including the need to involve our actuarial specialists  how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our audit procedures related to the workers compensation reserves included the following among others we tested the effectiveness of controls over workers compensation including those over payments and related expenses claims data provided to the actuary and review of actuarial results   we evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the workers compensation reserves by making selections of the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis including claims payments and related expenses to evaluate whether the inputs to the actuarial estimate were accurate and comparing management s prior year assumptions of expected future cost of claims and related expenses to actuals incurred during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of the workers compensation reserves   with the assistance of our actuarial specialists we developed independent estimates of the reserves and compared our estimates to the company s recorded reserves   s deloitte touche llp seattle

reclassified within current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows to conform to current year presentation  fiscal period end the consolidated financial statements are presented on a 52 53 week fiscal year end basis with the last day of the fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to the last day of december  in fiscal years consisting of 53 weeks the final quarter will consist of 14 weeks while fiscal years consisting of 52 weeks all quarters will consist of 13 weeks  all years presented include 52 weeks  revenue recognition we account for a contract when both parties to the contract have approved the contract the rights of the parties are identified payment terms are identified the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable  revenues are recognized over time using an output measure as the control of the promised services is transferred to the client in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services  the majority of our contracts are short term in nature as they are filling the contingent staffing needs of our clients or include termination clauses that allow either party to cancel within a short notice period without cause  revenue includes billable travel and other reimbursable costs and are reported net of sales use or other transaction taxes collected from clients and remitted to taxing authorities  payment terms vary by client and the services offered however we do not extend payment terms beyond one year  substantially all of our contracts include payment terms of 90 days or less  we primarily record revenue on a gross basis as a principal versus on a net basis as an agent on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  we have determined that gross reporting as a principal is the appropriate treatment based upon the following key factors we maintain the direct contractual relationship with the client and are responsible for fulfilling the service promised to the client   we demonstrate control over the services provided to our clients by being the employer of record for the individuals performing the service   we establish our worker s billing rate  contingent staffing we recognize revenue for our peopleready and peoplemanagement contingent staffing services over time as services are performed in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to collect in exchange for our services which is generally calculated as hours worked multiplied by the agreed upon hourly bill rate  the client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services as they are provided  we do not incur costs to obtain our contingent staffing contracts  costs are incurred to fulfill some contingent staffing contracts however these costs are not material and are expensed as incurred   page 45 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements human resource outsourcing we primarily recognize revenue for our peoplescout outsourced recruitment of permanent employees over time in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for our services  the client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services as they are provided  we do not incur costs to obtain our outsourced recruitment of permanent employee contracts  the costs to fulfill these contracts are not material and are expensed as incurred  unsatisfied performance obligations as a practical expedient we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for i contracts with an expected original duration of one year or less and ii contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed  cost of services cost of services refers to costs directly associated with the earning of revenue and primarily includes wages and related payroll taxes and workers compensation expenses  cost of services also includes billable travel as well as other reimbursable and non reimbursable expenses  advertising costs advertising costs consist primarily of print and other promotional activities  we expense advertisements as of the first date the advertisements take place  advertising expenses included in selling general and administrative sg a expense were 6 8 million 8 1 million and 7 3 million in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively  cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents  investments with original maturities greater than three months are classified as marketable securities  we do not buy and hold securities principally for the purpose of selling them in the near future  our investment policy is focused on the preservation of capital liquidity and return  from time to time we may sell certain securities but the objective is not to generate profits on short term differences in price  we manage our cash equivalents and marketable securities as a single portfolio of highly liquid securities  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our clients to make required payments  the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on current collection efforts historical collection trends write off experience client credit risk and current economic data  the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses  past due balances are written off when it is probable the receivable will not be collected  restricted cash and investments cash and investments pledged as collateral and restricted for use in workers compensation insurance programs are included as restricted cash and investments on our consolidated balance sheets  our investments consist of highly rated investment grade debt securities which at the time of purchase were rated a1 p1 or higher for short term securities and a or higher for long term securities by nationally recognized rating organizations  we have the positive intent and ability to hold our restricted investments until maturity in accordance with our investment policy and accordingly all of our restricted investments are classified as held to maturity  in the event that an investment is downgraded it is replaced with a highly rated investment grade security  we review for impairment on a quarterly basis and do not consider temporary unrealized losses to be an impairment  we have an agreement with american international group inc  and the bank of new york mellon corporation creating a trust trust which holds the majority of our collateral obligations under existing workers compensation insurance policies  placing the collateral in the trust allows us to manage the investment of the assets and provides greater protection of those assets   page 46 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements fair value of financial instruments and investments fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date  for assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis we determine fair value based on the following level 1 the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents and mutual funds approximates fair value because of the short term nature of these instruments  inputs are valued using quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level 2 inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities are used  we use quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or we estimate the fair value using a variety of valuation methodologies which include observable inputs for comparable instruments and unobservable inputs   level 3 for assets and liabilities with unobservable inputs we typically rely on management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash approximates fair value because of the short term maturity of those instruments  we hold mutual funds and money market funds to support our deferred compensation liability which are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets  there are inherent limitations when estimating the fair value of financial instruments and the fair values reported are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized in current market transactions  the carrying value of our accounts receivable accounts payable and other accrued expenses and accrued wages and benefits approximates fair value due to their short term nature  in addition to mutual funds and money market funds we also have company owned life insurance policies that support our deferred compensation liability  company owned life insurance policies are carried at cash surrender value which approximates fair value  we also hold certain restricted investments which collateralize workers compensation programs and are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost on our consolidated balance sheets  certain items such as goodwill and other intangible assets are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a non recurring basis  we determine the fair value of these items using level 3 inputs  property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost  we compute depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows years buildings 40 software 3 8 computers furniture and equipment 3 10 leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the related non cancelable lease term or their estimated useful lives  non capital expenditures associated with opening new locations are expensed as incurred  when property is retired or otherwise disposed of the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss net of proceeds is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  repairs and maintenance costs are charged directly to expense as incurred  major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated  costs associated with the acquisition or development of software for internal use are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the software from three to eight years  a subsequent addition modification or upgrade to internal use software is capitalized to the extent that it enhances the software s functionality or extends its useful life  software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period incurred  leases we conduct our branch office operations from leased locations  we also lease office spaces for our centralized support functions office equipment and machinery for use at client sites  many leases require variable payments of property taxes insurance and page 47 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements common area maintenance in addition to base rent  the variable portion of these lease payments is not included in our right of use assets or lease liabilities  rather variable payments other than those dependent upon an index or rate are expensed when the obligation for those payments is incurred and are included in sg a expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  the terms of our lease agreements generally range from three to five years some containing options to renew or cancel  we determine if an arrangement meets the definition of a lease at inception at which time we also perform an analysis to determine whether the lease qualifies as operating or financing  operating leases are included in operating lease right of use assets and operating lease current and long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets  lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term and is included in sg a expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  financing leases are included in property and equipment net other current liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets  lease expense for financing leases is recognized as depreciation of the right of use asset and interest expense  lease right of use assets and lease liabilities are measured using the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date  the right of use asset also includes any lease payments made on or before the commencement date of the lease less any lease incentives received  as the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in our leases we use our incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments  the incremental borrowing rates used are estimated based on what we would be required to pay for a collateralized loan over a similar term  we have lease agreements with lease and non lease components which are accounted for as a single lease component  for leases with an initial non cancelable lease term of less than one year and no option to purchase we have elected not to recognize the lease on our consolidated balance sheets and instead recognize rent payments on a straight line basis over the lease term within sg a expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  in addition for those leases where the right to cancel the lease is available to both trueblue as the lessee and the lessor the lease term is the initial non cancelable period plus the notice period which is typically 90 days and not greater than one year  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the first day of our fiscal second quarter and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred  these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate operating performance indicators competition client engagement legal factors or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit  we monitor the existence of potential impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year  we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level  we consider our operating segments to be our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing  our operating segments are peopleready centerline drivers centerline staff management smx staff management simos insourcing solutions simos peoplescout and peoplescout msp  the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill  fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit  if the fair value exceeds the carrying value we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of the goodwill  determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions to evaluate the impact of operational and macroeconomic changes on each reporting unit  the fair value of each reporting unit is a weighted average of the income and market valuation approaches  the income approach applies a fair value methodology based on discounted cash flows  this analysis requires significant estimates and judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital which is risk adjusted to reflect the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested  we also apply a market approach which identifies similar publicly traded companies and develops a correlation referred to as a multiple to apply to the operating results of the reporting units  the primary market multiples to which we compare are revenue and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization  the income and market approaches were equally weighted in our most recent annual impairment test  we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain  actual future results may differ from those estimates  we consider a reporting unit s fair value to be substantially in excess of its carrying value at a 20 premium or greater  we performed our goodwill impairment tests for 2019 2018 and 2017 and determined that the estimated fair values exceeded the carrying amounts for our reporting units  accordingly no impairment loss was recognized for the years ended december 29 2019 december 30 2018 or december 31 2017   page 48 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements we have indefinite lived intangible assets related to our staff management and peoplescout trade names  we test our trade names annually for impairment and when indications of potential impairment exist  we performed our annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test for 2019 2018 and 2017 and determined that the estimated fair values exceeded the carrying amounts for our indefinite lived trade names  accordingly no impairment loss was recognized for the years ended december 29 2019 december 30 2018 or december 31 2017  other long lived assets other long lived assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable  other long lived assets include property and equipment lease right of use assets finite lived intangible assets and capitalized implementation costs for cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts  we have finite lived intangible assets related to acquired company customers trade names trademarks and technology as well as purchased trade names trademarks  we capitalize implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract  capitalized implementation costs are recorded as a prepaid asset in other assets net on our consolidated balance sheets with the related amortization recorded in sg a expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the fixed non cancelable term of the associated arrangement plus any reasonably certain renewal periods  software license fees incurred during the development period are expensed as incurred  business combinations we account for our business acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting  the fair value of the net assets acquired and the results of the acquired business are included in the financial statements from the acquisition date forward  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and results of operations during the reporting period  estimates are used in accounting for among other things the fair value of acquired net operating assets property and equipment intangible assets useful lives of property and equipment and amortizable lives for acquired intangible assets  any excess of the purchase consideration over the identified fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is recognized as goodwill  goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit s expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date  we estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as of the date of the acquisition based on information available at that time  the initial valuation of these tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities is subject to further management review and may change between the preliminary allocation and the final allocation  all acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in sg a expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  additionally we recognize liabilities for anticipated restructuring costs that will be necessary due to the elimination of excess capacity redundant assets or unnecessary functions and record them as sg a expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  workers compensation claims reserves we maintain reserves for workers compensation claims using actuarial estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses  these estimates include claims that have been reported but not settled and claims that have been incurred but not reported  these reserves which reflect potential liabilities to be paid in future periods based on estimated payment patterns are discounted to estimated net present value using discount rates based on average returns of risk free u s  treasury instruments which are evaluated on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the reserves regularly throughout the year and make adjustments accordingly  if the actual cost of such claims and related expenses exceeds the amounts estimated additional reserves may be required  changes in reserve estimates are reflected in cost of services on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income in the period when the changes are made  our workers compensation reserves include estimated expenses related to claims above our self insured limits excess claims and a corresponding receivable for the insurance coverage on excess claims based on the contractual policy agreements we have with insurance companies  we discount the liability and its corresponding receivable to its estimated net present value using the risk free rates associated with the actuarially determined weighted average lives of our excess claims  when appropriate based on our best estimate we record a valuation allowance against the insurance receivable to reflect amounts that may not be realized  legal contingency reserves and regulatory liabilities from time to time we are subject to compliance audits by federal state and local authorities relating to a variety of regulations including wage and hour laws taxes workers compensation immigration and safety  in addition we are subject to legal page 49 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements proceedings in the ordinary course of our operations  we establish accruals for contingent legal and regulatory liabilities when management determines that it is probable that a legal claim will result in an adverse outcome and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated  we evaluate our reserve regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed  if the actual outcome of these matters is different than expected an adjustment is charged or credited to expense in the period the outcome occurs or the period in which the estimate changes  income taxes and related valuation allowance we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or receivable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns  these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated  future tax law changes such as changes to the federal and state corporate tax rates and the mix of states and their taxable income could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations  when appropriate we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized  in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events and past operating results  based on that analysis we have determined that a valuation allowance is appropriate for certain net operating losses and tax credits that we expect will not be utilized within the permitted carryforward periods as of december 29 2019 and december 30 2018  a significant driver of fluctuations in our effective income tax rate is the work opportunity tax credit wotc  wotc is designed to encourage hiring of workers from certain disadvantaged targeted categories and is generally calculated as a percentage of wages over a twelve month period up to worker maximum by targeted category  based on historical results and business trends we estimate the amount of wotc we expect to earn related to wages of the current year  however the estimate is subject to variation because 1 a small percentage of our workers qualify for one or more of the many targeted categories 2 the targeted categories are subject to different incentive credit rates and limitations 3 credits fluctuate depending on economic conditions and qualified worker retention periods and 4 state and federal offices can delay their credit certification processing and have inconsistent certification rates  we recognize additional prior year hiring credits if credits in excess of original estimates have been certified by government offices  deferred compensation plan we offer a non qualified defined contribution plan the plan to eligible employees  participating employees may elect to defer and contribute a portion of their eligible compensation  the plan allows participants to direct their account based on the investment options determined by trueblue and offers discretionary matching contributions  the current portion of the deferred compensation liability is included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets  the total deferred compensation liability is largely offset by deferred compensation mutual funds money market funds and company owned life insurance policies recorded in restricted cash and investments on our consolidated balance sheets  the mutual funds and money market funds are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in sg a expense while realized gains and losses are recorded in other income on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  the carrying value of company owned life insurance policies is based on the cash surrender value of the policies and accordingly approximates fair value  changes in the cash surrender value of the insurance policies are recorded in sg a expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  stock based compensation under various plans officers employees and non employee directors have received or may receive grants of stock restricted stock awards performance share units or options to purchase common stock  we also have an employee stock purchase plan espp  compensation expense for restricted stock awards and performance share units is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period based on the stock s fair market value on the grant date  for performance share unit grants issued with performance conditions compensation expense is recognized over each vesting period based on assessment of the likelihood of meeting these conditions  we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and performance share units that is expected to vest rather than record forfeitures when they occur  if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in the future periods  foreign currency our consolidated financial statements are reported in u s  dollars  assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries with non u s  dollar functional currencies are translated to u s  dollars at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date  revenues and page 50 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements expenses for each subsidiary are translated to u s  dollars using a weighted average rate for the relevant reporting period  translation adjustments resulting from this process are included net of tax in other comprehensive income when applicable  purchases and retirement of our common stock we purchase our common stock under a program authorized by our board of directors  under applicable washington state law shares purchased are not displayed separately as treasury stock on the consolidated balance sheets and are treated as authorized but unissued shares  it is our accounting policy to first record these purchases as a reduction to our common stock account  once the common stock account has been reduced to a nominal balance remaining purchases are recorded as a reduction to our retained earnings  furthermore activity in our common stock account related to stock based compensation is also recorded to retained earnings until such time as the reduction to retained earnings due to stock repurchases has been recovered  net income per share basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period  diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares outstanding during the period  potential common shares include the dilutive effects of vested and non vested restricted stock performance share units and shares issued under the espp except where their inclusion would be anti dilutive  anti dilutive shares primarily include non vested restricted stock and performance share units for which the sum of the assumed proceeds including unrecognized compensation expense exceeds the average stock price during the periods presented  anti dilutive shares associated with our stock options relate to those stock options with an exercise price higher than the average market value of our stock during the periods presented  use of estimates preparing financial statements in conformity with u s  gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses  estimates in our consolidated financial statements include but are not limited to purchase accounting allowance for doubtful accounts estimates for asset and goodwill impairments stock based performance awards assumptions underlying self insurance reserves contingent legal and regulatory liabilities and the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements  actual results and outcomes may differ from these estimates and assumptions  recently adopted accounting standards intangibles goodwill and other internal use software in august 2018 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance on accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract  the standard aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal use software and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license  previously we expensed the cost of internal development labor as incurred  the new guidance requires these costs be capitalized with the related amortization recorded in sg a expense  in addition capitalized development costs are required to be recorded as a prepaid asset rather than a fixed asset and license fees incurred during the development period are expensed as incurred  the standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2019 with early adoption permitted  we elected to early adopt this new standard prospectively as of the first day of our fiscal first quarter in 2019  there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption  leases in february 2016 the fasb issued guidance on lease accounting  the new guidance continues to classify leases as either finance or operating but results in the lessee recognizing most operating leases on the balance sheet as right of use assets and lease liabilities  this guidance was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2018 q1 2019 for trueblue with early adoption permitted  in july 2018 the fasb amended the standard to provide transition relief for comparative reporting allowing companies to adopt the provisions of the new standard using a modified retrospective transition method on the adoption date with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings recorded on the date of adoption  we elected to adopt the standard page 51 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements using the transition relief provided in the july amendment  we implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the reporting of financial information  we elected the three practical expedients allowed for implementation of the new standard but did not utilize the hindsight practical expedient  accordingly we did not reassess 1 whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases 2 the lease classification for any expired or existing leases 3 initial direct costs for any existing leases  we also elected the practical expedient to not separate non lease components from the lease components to which they relate and instead account for them as a single lease component  accordingly all fixed expenses associated with a lease contract are accounted for as lease expenses  adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of operating right of use assets and lease liabilities of 39 million and 41 million respectively as of the first day of our fiscal first quarter of 2019  the difference between the right of use assets and lease liabilities relates to the deferred rent liability balance as of the end of fiscal 2018 associated with the leases capitalized  the deferred rent liability which was the difference between the straight line lease expense and cash paid reduced the right of use asset upon adoption  our accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged  the standard did not materially impact our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income or our consolidated statements of cash flows  recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in june 2016 the fasb issued guidance on accounting for credit losses on financial instruments  this guidance sets forth a current expected credit loss model which requires the measurement of credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income  the guidance requires the application of a current expected credit loss model which is a new impairment model based on expected losses  under this model an entity recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses based on historical experience current conditions and forecasted information rather than the current methodology of delaying recognition of credit losses until it is probable a loss has been incurred  this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 q1 2020 for trueblue with early adoption permitted  we plan to adopt the new guidance in q1 2020 related to our trade accounts receivables held to maturity debt securities and insurance receivable and expect the total impact upon adoption to be immaterial  no other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  note 2 acquisition and divestiture 2018 acquisition effective june 12 2018

planetechs for a sales price of 11 4 million of which 8 5 million was paid in cash and 1 6 million in a note receivable with monthly principal payments of 0 1 million beginning in april 2018  the

key clients that individually account for more than 10 of revenue for the simos reporting unit  for each client we service multiple sites  the loss of a key client loss of a significant number of key sites or a downturn in the economy could give rise to an impairment  should any one of these events occur we may need to record an impairment loss to goodwill for the amount by which the carrying

value as of the annual impairment test by approximately 48 and there were no indicators of impairment during the interim period  therefore no interim impairment test was required for this reporting unit  based on the annual impairment test for simos the estimated fair value was in excess of its carrying value by approximately 10  because the estimated fair value of goodwill for simos was not substantially in excess of its carrying value we tested the simos reporting unit for impairment prior to the combination with staff management  the result of the most recent impairment test indicated the estimated fair value remains in excess of carrying value by approximately 7  therefore no impairment loss was recognized   page 58 table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements note

cover claims for a particular event above a 2 0 million deductible limit on a per occurrence basis  this results in our being substantially self insured  for workers compensation claims originating in washington north dakota ohio wyoming canada and puerto rico our monopolistic jurisdictions we pay workers compensation insurance premiums and obtain full coverage under government administered programs with the exception of peopleready in ohio where we have a self insured policy  accordingly because we are not the primary obligor our consolidated financial statements do not reflect the liability for workers compensation claims in these monopolistic jurisdictions  our workers compensation reserve is established using estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported but not settled as well as those that have been incurred but not reported  our workers compensation reserve for claims below the deductible limit is discounted to its estimated net present value using discount rates based on average returns of risk free u s  treasury instruments available during the year in which the liability was incurred  the weighted average discount rate was 2 0 at december 29 2019 and december 30 2018  payments made against self insured claims are made over a weighted average period of approximately 5 years as of december 29 2019  the following table

claims based on the contractual policy agreements we have with insurance carriers  we discount this reserve and corresponding receivable to its estimated net present value using the discount rates based on average returns of risk free u s  treasury instruments available during the year in which the liability was incurred  at december 29 2019 and december 30 2018 the weighted average rate was 2
